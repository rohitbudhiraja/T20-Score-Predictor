# T20-Score-Predictor

It is T-20 World cup season, so let’s predict what total our team can score. Here, I have combined data from all the men’s T20s which have taken place so far and trained my model using XGBoost to give us a prediction of final score, on the basis of Batting Team, Bowling Team, Over Played, Wickets Lost, Current Runs and Runs scored in the last 5 overs.

The app.py file can be opened in PyCharm and yes it does work like a charm. To confirm that the model runs accurately, you can check scores from the matches which have happened in the past, given that you enter the correct information.

Hope, all the cricket and data enthusiasts will find this useful.
